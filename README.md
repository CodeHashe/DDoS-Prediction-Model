🚨 Detecting DDoS Attacks Using Machine Learning on the CIC-IDS-2017 Dataset 🚨

As part of a recent project in cybersecurity and data science, I analyzed the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset—specifically the Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-DDos file—to build and evaluate models for DDoS attack detection.

🔧 Preprocessing steps included:

Handling missing values

Normalizing numerical features

Removing redundant columns

Encoding categorical labels

📊 Models Trained & Evaluated:

Logistic Regression – Baseline binary classification

Random Forest – Ensemble learning with multiple decision trees

LightGBM – Fast, efficient gradient boosting

XGBoost – Highly optimized gradient boosting

📈 Results (F1-Score):

Logistic Regression: 95%

Random Forest: 98%

LightGBM: 98.5%

XGBoost: 99%

✅ Key Takeaways:

XGBoost outperformed all with near-perfect detection capability.

LightGBM offered excellent speed and scalability.

Proper preprocessing and feature selection significantly boosted model performance.

Traditional models like SVM and KNN struggled with high-dimensional data.

🔍 Inspired by previous works such as:

Gharib et al. (2019): Highlighted Random Forest’s accuracy on the same dataset

Vinayakumar et al. (2018): Showed the power of XGBoost and DNNs for intrusion detection

💡 Looking ahead, I’m excited to explore hybrid deep learning models and further improve real-time threat detection systems.
